		"question": "How do I get a good guitar amp tone out of the box?",
		"answer": "For a good clean sound, adjust the EQ controls to create a warm, full sound - Bass around 3 o’clock, Mid around 1 o’clock, and Treble around 11 o’clock. Pickups make a lot of difference too, the neck pickup will produce a warmer sound, where the bridge pickup will create a thinner, more funky sound. For a fat, crunch sound, balance the gain and volume controls to achieve the amount of overdrive you like. The more gain you add, the more saturated the tone will become, and you will have to adjust the EQ (Bass & Treble) depending on the style of music, to avoid your tone becoming muddy.",

For a simple structure on a budget, you could create a simple wooden frame, approximately 2m2 x 3m3, and insulate it with rockwool. Then you could cover the booth with plywood, and cover the fourth side with a heavy curtain to complete the soundproofing.",

		"answer": "In a live situation, you are most likely going to be using a dynamic microphone, such as the SM57. It can handle loud volumes very well, and rejects a lot of the sound from around the stage. Other options could be the Shure Beta 58A, EV N/D367S N, Samson Q7 or T.Bone MB 34 II. In a recording situation, vocals are most commonly recorded with a Large Diaphragm Condenser microphone, such as the Rode NT2a; which have a very wide frequency response and sensitivity.",

		"answer": "1. Make sure your technical skills are up to par - is the song in the right key? Are you making sure to use the write muscles in your body to support your voice? 2. Endurance plays a big part in vocal performance, adequate rest and hydration are very important. 3. Make sure you are not tense at all, which can induce fatigue quickly. 4. Make sure you are adequately monitoring yourself so you are not straining to hear your own performance.",

With a 5 String bass you have an extended range and you can play more easily in position, however the neck is much wider than a 4 string, and there is the potential to get confused with the lower string. With a 4 string bass, the neck is thinner and more accessible, and the skills are more transferable onto a 5 string if needed.",

		"answer": "Drums - Portability and Transportation is key, what is suitable for the band and venue. Make sure you regularly replace drum heads and worn parts, and always carry spares! Guitar - Fresh strings and batteries for acoustic guitars are essential, as is using a guitar that you are familiar with and can rely on. Make sure to use good quality cables such as D’addario, and bring an appropriate amp (volume wise) for the venue, transport, and band! Keys - A good access to a wide range of sounds in a portable package is key, from both the perspective of pianos and keyboards, to synthesisers. Portability is an important aspect, 88 key units are create, but something like a 61 key may be more suitable to move around easily.",

		"answer": "Short answer: Always. Before every rehearsal or lesson you should be warming up, just for 2-3 minutes (Sirens and main areas you are working on). When gigging, warm up properly before the gig, but only repeat between sets if the gap is longer than 20-30 minutes. Cooling down is also important after rehearsals and gigs.",

		"question": "How often should guitarists change strings, depending on how much we play?",
		"answer": "It’s different for everyone, as some people have a very high alkaline sweat, meaning strings need to be changed every few days depending on how much you play. Some people are luckier and only need to change every 2-3 months without intensive gigs. If your strings feel dead or look black, then change them - you wont usually hear an audible difference between old and new strings.",

		"answer": "As it is highly subjective from person to person as to what ‘Good Jazz’ actually is, it’s very hard to answer this question specifically. In our minds, all composition is improvisation, and all composition is improvisation in some way. The process of improvisation, when written down with a defined structure could be described as a finished composition, as most Jazz tunes feature a fixed ‘head’, in addition to improvised sections. The line can be very blurred between the two, regardless of genre.",

		"month": "March 2018",

		"answer": "Confidence stems from technique specifically, particularly singing louder or higher. Practice development of your core muscles to support your voice. Another aspect is general confidence, in overcoming shyness and nerves on stage or when singing in front of others. This again comes with time and practice; find what your scared of or not good at yet, and practice that.",

		"question": "Ideal amp options for classic rock covers band, and amp and pedal set ups?",
		"answer": "For a budget player, look for a small amp with a DI output for gigging (to reduce stage volume). For Hendrix/Gilmour tones, you will need a wah pedal. Another great multi-fx pedal is the Zoom Multistomp, which allows 4 effects at once, including reverb, delay and overdrive. For a mid-range budget, keep the pedals the same, but upgrade the amp to a small valve amp, such as the IRT studio. For a money-no-object budget, replace the pedals and amps completely with a Line 6 Helix multi-effects unit, to go directly into the FOH system and monitors.",

It’s not easy, and you have to consider a lot of things - as a singer your instrument is your body, so you have to know that everything you do will affect your voice; diet, sleep, exercise, work. There is no one way to go about making a career in the music industry, trends come and go and the main thing to focus on is being adaptable.",

		"answer": "In most live situations, you want to be plugging an electric bass directly into the PA for the best sound, and monitoring it through IEM’s or stage monitors. For practicing at home, it is possible to plug a bass head into a PA speaker, but check first on the speaker and amp impedances to avoid blowing up anything!",

		"answer": "Soundproofing and acoustic treatment are commonly taken for being the same thing, however they are very different. Soundproofing is used to insulate and isolate the sound in a space, keeping in sounds and keeping out others. Materials such a rockwool, MLV, and acoustic sealant are great for this. Acoustic treatment is usually added on top of this to ‘treat’ a room to balance frequencies and reduce unwanted ones. Bass Traps and Acoustic tiles are commonly used to control frequencies in a live room or control room.",
